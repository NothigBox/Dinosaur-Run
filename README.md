# Timba-Technical-Test

As hyper casual-game I chosen the Chrome Dinosaur as it counts with an easy to implement gameplay that includes score (for the ranking). 

Firebase is the service where the database is located at; natalia.orduz@timba.co is the e-mail that can enter to the following 
link: https://timba-technical-test-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/

To try this game locally: in the editor, set the variable "Mode" in the GameManager as "Local". The ranking won't appear in consecuence.

Thanks for this opportunity of entering to the Timba team, and please let me know how everything goes. :)
